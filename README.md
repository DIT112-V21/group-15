# What are you going to make?

Our goal for this project is to make an Android application that enables users to cantrol smart cars. As a stretch goal we have the idea 
of creating a voice command application that helps the users be able to control and manuever the car with only the use of their voice. 

# Why will you make it?

Our tool or application can enable people with disabilities to be able to drive and live a normal life. 

# What problem does it solve?

The system can be used for instance with amputees, or any other type of disability where these people still can use their voice. It will help amputees to at least be able to transport, and visit places without depending on someone else. 

# How are you going to make it?

Right now we have the idea of making this into work by using the ultrasonic sensors where we can assure that the smart car will avoid obstacles all the time, because safety is our number one concern. As our stretch goal we want to make use of voice commands in the application where people can drive and control the car with the least effort of using just their voice.  

# What kind of technology are you going to use?

In order to develop the system, we’re planning to use C++, Javascript and Java through the Arduino IDE and possibly other IDE’s if necessary but also the SMCE and Smart car Library that we were given. We’re also going to use multiple social media platforms so that we can communicate and follow up on each other's work such as Google drive and GitHub.
