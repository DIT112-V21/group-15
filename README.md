- What are you going to make?
We are going to make an Autonomous warehouse smart car with a carrier (Automated storage car) which follows the smart car in front of it. This is the concept that we can use in the warehouses to transfer the goods from one place to the other and with the help of our idea we will increase time efficiency.
- Why will you make it?
We see this as a great idea to increase the efficiency in the warehouses where there is a lot of transferring of goods so this idea can come in help in real life.
- What problem does it solve?
It will solve a great problem for the warehouses where there's a lot of goods to transfer from one place to the other, In that case there will be a carrier that connects and follows the car in front of it without any man power.
- How are you going to make it?
Right now we have the idea of making this into work by using the ultrasonic sensors where we can say that the carrier car maintains a specific distance from the car in front of it and if the distance exceeds the initial distance then the carrier moves.
What kind of technology are you going to use?
In order to develop the system, we’re planning to use C++, Javascript and Java through the Arduino IDE and possibly other IDE’s if necessary but also the SMCE and Smart car Library that we were given. We’re also going to use multiple social media platforms so that we can communicate and follow up on each other's work such as Google drive and GitHub.
