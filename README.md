# What are you going to make?
We are going to make a car that can be controlled by an application. As a stretch goal we have the idea
of creating an autonomous warehouse smart car with a carrier (Automated storage car) which follows the smart car in front of it.
Through the help of image processing. 

# Why will you make it?
This is a concept that we can use in warehouses to transfer goods from one place to another and with the help of our 
idea we can increase time efficiency.

# What problem does it solve?
It will help solve a great problem for warehouses where there's a lot of goods to transfer from one place to the other,

# How are you going to make it?
Right now we have the idea of making this into work by using the ultrasonic sensors where we can say that the carrier car 
maintains a specific distance from the car in front of it and if the distance exceeds the initial distance then the carrier moves.
We can initialize this idea by using the camera that is implemented in the emulator. Through this we can process
the images the car can detect what kind of object is in front of it. 

# What kind of technology are you going to use?
In order to develop the system, we’re planning to use C++, Javascript and Java through the Arduino IDE and possibly other IDE’s if necessary but also the SMCE and Smart car Library that we were given. We’re also going to use multiple social media platforms so that we can communicate and follow up on each other's work such as Google drive and GitHub.
